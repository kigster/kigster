<h2>About Me</h2>

- üåè I live in San Francisco, California, USA, but I often visit Melbourne, Australia, where I got my Mathematics degree (at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/)) and where my family lives.
- üî≠ I maintained the open source [rules_ruby for Bazel](https://github.com/bazelruby/rules_ruby), and now helping with the [canonical ruby rules](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_ruby). 
- üì´ How to reach me: [@kig](https://twitter.com/kig)

<h2>Industry Experience</h2>

* I've been a technical, hands-on CTO and VP of Engineering for at least five times.
* I recently helped refine the VC pitch for [Made Technologies](https://made.tech)
* Before that, I was a Staff Software Engineer for [HealthSherpa](https://healthsherpa.com).
* Before that, I was a Staff Software Engineer at [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) and [Fossa](https://fossa.com).
* In 2012-2015 I was a CTO at [Wanelo](https://wanelo.co), which was a Rails site that:
  1. Was wholly rewritten from a Java/JSP prototype with 100K lines of code and no tests to a 10K line of a Rails app with 98% test coverage in 2 months with six people pairing full time.
  2. Our Java codebase crashed at 3K RPMs, but once we migrated to Rails, our traffic skyrocketed about 100x in six months, reaching the peak traffic of 300,000 RPMs at an average latency of about 100m.
  3. We won TechCrunch Disrupt and were installed on about 50% of all teenage phones.
  4. At Wanelo, we had to shard our PostgreSQL database, use RabbitMQ for asynchronous and decoupled communications, and open source many of our adapters as ruby gems.

<h3>Ruby</h3>

I am a big open-source proponent, and I wrote about a few dozen open-source [Ruby gems](https://rubygems.org/profiles/kigster) with over 120M downloads.

Among the most popular gems are:

* [colored2](https://github.com/kigster/colored2) ‚Äî ASCII color ruby gem
* [sym](https://github.com/kigster/sym) ‚Äî Symmetric encryption vi CLI or API based on OpenSSL
* [simple-feed](https://github.com/kigster/simple-feed) - Redis based backend for Twitter-like Social Networks with constant read time
* [puma-daemon](https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon) ‚Äî Puma daemonization library

<h2>DevOps, Build, and Systems Configuration</h2>

I do a lot of Infrastructure and Scalability work, so among my other projects are:

* [C++/CMake Project Template](https://github.com/kigster/cmake-project-template) with Google Test library
* [Bazel/Starlark Projects](https://github.com/kigster?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=starlark&sort=stargazers) including Rules Ruby.
* [BASH Projects](https://github.com/kigster?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=shell&sort=stargazers).

<h2>Music</h2>

I play piano, guitar and [drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdAqqoRXIcM).

I've been DJ-ing since the vinyl days (house, tech-house, progressive, techno, downtempo) 

 * My DJ name is [LeftCtrl](https://soundcloud.com/leftctrl)

I also have been composing and producing electronic music for over 20 years, 

* My band name is [PolyGroovers](https://soundcloud.com/polygroovers). 
* Here is [the most recent playlist](https://soundcloud.com/polygroovers/sets/all-original-polygroovers).
* And [these are some of the classics](https://soundcloud.com/polygroovers/sets/the-best-of-polygroovers).

<h2>Hardware Projects</h2>

I have also written projects in [C/C++](https://github.com/kigster?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=cmake&sort=stargazers) for Arduino platform.

Some of my popular projects and posts are:

* [BORAT ‚Äî Bathroom Occupancy Remote Awareness Technology](https://kig.re/2014/10/12/borat-bathroom-occupancy-wireless-detection-and-notification-with-arduino.html)
* [Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance Library](https://github.com/kigster/back-seat-driver) for DC motors or Servo Motors.
* [How to use arduino nano mini pro with ch340g on Mac OS-X](https://kig.re/2014/12/31/how-to-use-arduino-nano-mini-pro-with-CH340G-on-mac-osx-yosemite.html)
