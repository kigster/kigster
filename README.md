<h2>About Me</h2>

- üåè I live in San Francisco, California, USA & I often visit Melbourne, Australia where I got my degree (at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/)) and where my family lives.
- üî≠ I maintained the open source [rules_ruby for Bazel](https://github.com/bazelruby/rules_ruby), and now helping with the [canonical ruby rules](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_ruby). 
- üì´ How to reach me: [@kig](https://twitter.com/kig)

<h2>Industry Experience</h2>

* I've been a technical hands-on CTO and VP of Engineering at least five timnes.
* Right now I am CTO and Co-Founder at [Made Technologies](https://made.tech)
* Before that, I was a Principal Software Engineer for [HealthSherpa](https://healthsherpa.com).
* Before that, I was a Staff Software Engineer at [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) and [Fossa](https://fossa.com).
* In 2012-2015 I was a CTO at [Wanelo](https://wanelo.co) which was a Rails site that:
  1. Was completely rewritten from a Java/JSP prototype with 100K lines of code and no tests, to a 10K lines of a Rails app with 98% test coverage in 2 months with six people pairing full time.
  2. Java codebase was crashing at 3K RPMs, but once we migrated to Rails, our traffic skyrocketed about 100x in six months, reaching the peak traffic of 300,000 RPMs at an average latency of about 100m.
  3. We won TechCrunch Disrtupt and were installed on about 50% of all teenager phones.
  4. At Wanelo we had to horizontally shard our PostgreSQL database, use RabbitMQ and we open source all of our adapters as gems.

<h3>Ruby</h3>

I am big open-source proponent, and I wrote about a few dozen open-source [Ruby gems](https://rubygems.org/profiles/kigster) with over 120M downloads.
